                <p>A model is a simplified representation or simulation of a system, process, or concept, designed to help understand,
                    analyze, or predict its behavior. Models can be physical, mathematical, or conceptual, providing valuable insights
                    for research, experimentation, and problem-solving across various disciplines.
                </p>
                <p>We have designed a 3D model for our coconut products manufacturing factory. We have first designed our ideas about
                    our business and how to build the factory. Then we have designed this 2D Diagram.
                </p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-7 d-none d-lg-block">
                        <img src="resouces/images/2dmodel.png" style="width: 700px;" class="mx-auto mt-2 mb-2" />
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12 col-lg-4 mt-lg-5">
                        <p>As in the 2D diagram, the main component is <b>Our Coconut Manufacturing Factory</b>. In the factory we have
                            many machines for our processes. First we collect Coconut from our coconut gave as well as from other vendors.
                            Then we shell coconuts, clean coconuts, crackle coconuts and prepare recieved coconuts for the process.
                        </p>
                        <p>After preparing coconuts we start our process. After manufacturing the products, we do packages and labling
                            processes in the factory. After that, we load all packages to the lorries. Then we deliver them for our
                            customers.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="mt-lg-3">Then there is the <b>Main Office</b>. All work is managed in the main office. There are several
                    departments in the office such as HR department, Finance department, Marketing department, and etc. And then there
                    is <b>our Shop</b>. In the shop, we sell our manufactured coconut products like Coconut Water, Coconut Oil,
                    Coconut Butter, Coconut Milk, and more. Also we sell some amount of raw Coconuts in our shop. Also in the diagram,
                    there ia a lorry park to park lorries which came to deliver packages. Also wo have a car park in the office premises.
                    Also we have our own coconut grove to harvest coconut.
                </p>
                <p>After drawing this 2D diagram, we have built a 3D model for our business. The advantages of a 3D model for a
                    business are manifold. It facilitates enhanced visualization, aiding in product design, architectural planning,
                    and marketing materials. It improves communication by presenting complex ideas in a more understandable manner.
                    Additionally, 3D models streamline prototyping, reduce errors, and contribute to cost and time efficiency,
                    ultimately boosting overall productivity and competitiveness.
                </p>
                <p>This is the 3D model we built. This is the model designed to include pur entire coconut manufacturing factory
                    and related head office as well as small shop.
